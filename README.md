# GRLCM package - Global to Regional and Local Circulation Models

This is an R-code that allows to easily manage GIS processes for bringing General Circulation Models (GCM) into Regional or Local Circulation Models (RCM or LCM).
It includes all necessary 

Climate change studies requiere the outputs of GCM across different scenarios to be used as future data (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5). However, this outputs are avaliable only at a global scale, with coarse spatial resolution (1Â° or higher), so not being useful for more regional or local scales studies.

Several GIS (Geographical Information Systems) processes are required to bring GCM to RCM or LCM, and depending on the characteristics of each GCM data, more or less steps can be needed.

GRLCM package makes it all easier by allowing you to interact with all tese tools in one platform. You need to upload a GCM output and follow the steps to bring it to your study area

The final proudct is a netCdf or raster file ready to be used for your research
